# Final-Year-Projects-
This repository contains two major project related to Machine Learning and Human Resource Analytics. 

The Jupyter Notebook code is based on the Heart Attack Prediction Model. 
It has been uploaded along with the Jupyter Notebook code, the Dataset ("heart.csv" and "o2saturation.csv") as well as the PDF File named "Heart Attack Prediction MP" explaining the project in detail. 
It is the likelihood of developing a heart disease or the prediction of heart attacks in human beings. 

The other PDF File is based on the Human Resource Analytics Project. 
It is a employee engagement survey conducted by me, on a small scale company named Maharashtra Electro Mechanical Works, in Mahape, Navi Mumbai.
I had visited the organization and carried out a successful employee engagement survey to determine the total percentage of employees that are committed to the organization.
There is no dataset for it. However, the project is based on the certain necessary parameters that explain the percentage of engaged employees in the organization.
It also talks about a few recommendations from my end to further improvise the engagement percentage. 
This project has been successfully employed using the predictive HR analytics using some analytical tools like Excel, SPSS etc.
